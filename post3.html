                <p>I've been guilty of publicly bemoaning the complexity of HTTPS. In the past, I've purchased SSL
                    certificates from third-party vendors and had trouble installing them. I've had certificates expire
                    and had to scramble to fix them. I've had to poke and prod hosting companies to help me ensure
                    things were going to renew correctly, and left unsatisfied.
                    <br>
                    But I'd say in the last few years, this has really chilled out. CSS-Tricks went HTTPS around five
                    years ago, so we're well past any struggles with insecure content or anything like that.
                </p>

                <p>The name of this blog post is the name of this little microsite project from Troy Hunt: HTTPS is
                    Easy! It's a four-part series of five-minute videos walking through the process of adding
                    enterprise-grade security to a site quickly and for free with Cloudflare. It almost feels like an ad
                    for Cloudflare, and I couldn't care less if it is, but Troy says:
                    <br>
                    <blockquote> [...] this isn't a commercial activity on my behalf; Cloudflare didn't engage me to
                        create this
                        and
                        it'll come as a surprise to them the first time they see it.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    It really is easy and free, so I feel like I'm doing my duty here in making up for past complaints
                    about HTTPS.
